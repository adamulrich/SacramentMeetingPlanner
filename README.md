# LDS Sacrament Meeting Planner
This project was a group final for BYU-I .Net SW Dev (CSE 325). Requirements were to build a .net core web app with CRUD support for a database that contains data for a typical LDS Sacrament Meeting. Meetings normally have:
* opening, closing, sacrament hymns
* opening and closing prayer
* 0 or more speakers
* optional special musical numbers or rest hymns

## components
* .net core 7
* SQLite
* razor pages

* 
* entity framework
